# Spam-News-Detection

Spam news detection refers to identifying and filtering out false, misleading, or low-quality news articles, commonly referred to as "spam news" or "fake news." This detection process involves using various techniques, algorithms, and technologies to analyze the content of news articles and assess their credibility and reliability.

The goal of spam news detection is to prevent the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and sensationalized content that can deceive or mislead readers. This is particularly important in today's digital age, where news can spread rapidly through social media and online platforms.
